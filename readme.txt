Requires at least: 4.0
Tested up to: 4.4 beta
Stable tag: 1.0.0

This plugin helps you to find conflicts between plugins on a website which is live.

== Description ==

With this plugin I hope to help all those who get asked by a theme or plugin developer to disable all other plugins in order to find out if a reported issue is caused by a conflict.

Especially when you only have a live site, this request is not easy to follow without an interruption.

Therefore, Debug Plugin Conflicts allows you to disable specific plugins only if you visit the frontend.

This plugin is meant to help those who get asked by support to find a plugin conflict on their own or support people who can now give a practical advise with a link to this plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `debug-plugin-conflicts` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to 'Tools > Debug Plugins' to set up which plugins to test

**Instructions and important Notes**

Not tested on multisites. Please send me feedback if you did.

If you have an issue with the plugins not being activated correctly then remove mu-plugins/plugin-conflicts-mu.php when you have issues
